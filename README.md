# Shopper Behavior Exploration and Market Basket Analysis using Apache Spark

Shopper Behavior EDA on 3 million+ grocery orders Instacart and FP-growth algorithm implementation using Apache Spark on Databricks

### Dataset

In this project, I have used Instacartâ€™s real dataset which was released on Kaggle in 2017.

This is an anonymized dataset containing a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, there are about 4 to 100 orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order.
The dataset can be downloaded from link below.
