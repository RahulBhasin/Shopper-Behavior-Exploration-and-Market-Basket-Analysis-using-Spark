# Shopper Behavior Exploration and Market Basket Analysis using Apache Spark

In this project I have performed Shopper Behavior EDA on 3 million+ grocery orders of Instacart and implemented FP-growth algorithm using Apache Spark on Databricks for Market Basket Analysis.

## Dataset

For this analysis, I have used Instacartâ€™s real dataset which was released on Kaggle in 2017.

This is an anonymized dataset containing a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, there are about 4 to 100 orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order.
The dataset can be downloaded from link below.

## Platform used

I have used Apache Spark for the implementation of this project and using **PySpark, SparkSql and Scala** programming languages for coding. You can try Apache Spark on the [Databricks](https://databricks.com/spark/about) cloud for free from the link below.
